I want to use this space to help me keep track of what im learning and how much im progressing in my coding journey. 
As of this week, im officially studying towards the Web Design unit at uni. I've been looking forward to this unit a lot. 
I have a lot to learn from it and im hoping the assignment is fun too. 

Im currently following along to Ania Kubow's 12+ hour bootcamp on youtube and its incredible. I've already learned loads
and im only an hour in. 

Im feeling motivated at the moment. I want to do cool things in life and I won't be able to do that being stuck at a desk. I have a great need to be self employed, that's kinda the dream for now & i hope its enough to keep me on track. 

It's a long road ahead, but I need to remember I will get there, one step at a time.
